# Photokatsu Return
A Repository for returning Photokatsu game.

This is sometimes codenamed: RePhotokatsu!, the Reverse-Enginerred Aikatsu! Photo on Stage!<br/>
Alternate name title: Aikatsu! Photo on Stage! The Return

I cannot provide iOS version at the moment, sorry. Only Android asset I've been extracted using APKtool.

## To-do list
- [x] Upload the Version 1.12.0 base
- [ ] Root the Photokatsu assets that was already installed on Android phone.
- [ ] Determine about the asset how to open this (such as vo_ichigo.sdad).
- [ ] Repack the Photokatsu new version (1.14.0) like Puchiguru Love Live Private Server (pokenesos) made.
- [ ] Fix the issue while trying create/load account Photokatsu (includes linked account from Twitter/LINE).
- [ ] Improve Android Version 8 through 13.
